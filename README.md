# web3-react-starter 

This is a simple web3 React starter kit that lets you package your app in a single HTML file with the JavaScript and CSS inlined.
Forked from [Arweave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/react-inline-source-starter/) and kitted out with [web3-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-react) to get you started
on your first web3 react app.
